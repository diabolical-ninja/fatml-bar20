## Notes

- Claims that views can't be create from prejudice & bias as it implies a non-prejudiced view exists
- Measurement depends on the view point & lens used
    - Distance could be straightline, travel time, path length
    - A single value could also vary depend on the circumstances of those using the metric
- Given the presence of abstraction in data, choices become increasing difficult to the point they cannot be mathematically ideal
    - A "natural" structure might not exist
- Need to be cognisant of the options, choices & rationales for decisions made given the above issue

*Exercise*: Every worm, must reach every apple, without their paths crossing
