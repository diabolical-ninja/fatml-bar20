## Notes

- Often times there are incompatibilities between fairness definitions making it difficult/impossible to balance across
    - Must make a decision & be aware of the trade-off
- Ran a survey to compare preference for accuracy vs FPR, noting they were incompatible for the survey (one equal & the other disparate & vice versa)
- More participants preferred the model that equalised FPR
