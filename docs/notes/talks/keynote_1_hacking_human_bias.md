## Notes

*Cognitive bias: a systematic pattern of deviation from rationality in judgement that may dictate behaviour*

- Develop robots that work with children as a therapy tool
- Base system design on existing human behaviours & patterns. Can exploit that to increase the level of engagement with the system.
    - For the designed robots it means demonstrating empathy & sympathy with the children by picking up key words & responding with physical movements that represent the appropriate empathetic response
    - Has resulted in better engagement & thus better therapy outcomes
- Most AI face algorithms are not trained on children
    - Application for uses with children is thus questionable
- Was able to build enough trust in the robots that humans would handover decision making to the robot & if it fails you give up straight away
- Assigning robots identities (gender, name, race, etc) peolpe's reactions to the robots change. The labelling influences the reactions & interactions of humans with these
- Trust can build overtime with inanimate systems/objects (ie robots) & if they fail over time can illicit real emotional responses from the users
