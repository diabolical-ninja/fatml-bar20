## Notes

- Aimed to determine whether common word embeddings (GLOVE, etc) contain bias
- Evaluated a number of tweets & found significant bias present
- Measure of bias is: ....
- Embeddings are useful for improving ML models & understanding the social world
- Still an open challenge to minimise/eliminate bias from embeddings
