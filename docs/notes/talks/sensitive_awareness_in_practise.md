## Notes

- Facebook evaluates the content of an ad & incorporates that in who to target
- When, why & how should companies collect sensitive data?
- Having the data hasn't shown any causal linkage with change
- Found the motivation for collective sensitive data wasn't driven by regulatory/legal compliance
    - **But** absence of data almost guarantee's abuse of those attributes
