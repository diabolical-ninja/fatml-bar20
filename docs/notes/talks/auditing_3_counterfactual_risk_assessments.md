## Notes

- Goal is to identify the students that require additional resources, eg a tutor
- Challenges are faced when intervention/observation as your altering the outcome
- Contend that counterfactuals provide a mechanism/model to assess the effectiveness & potential outcomes for the alternate scenario (no intervention)
- Leverage some definitions from causal inference to define their interpretation & implementation of counterfactuals
