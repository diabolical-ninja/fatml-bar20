## Notes

- Contend that most data science projects are untaken without interaction with the cohorts impacted/will interact with the project outcome(s)
- Developed an "algorithmic equity toolkit"
    - Primarily non-technical tools that can be used to interegate potential concerns in AI systems
- Will be releasing an interactive toolkit later this year. Should be available on the University of Washington site
- Method used to develop the framework is:  [Participatory Action Research (PAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_action_research)
    - Involves consultation with the community to be impacted
    - Using & considering their objectives & concerns
    - Can introduce considerable complexities to a solution
- The approach is primarily intended for local rather than global solutions, due to the differring objectives across communities
    - May not be feasible to account for all global considerations
- **Recommendation is to engage those impacted by the project up front**
