## Notes

- Different understandings/meanings of trust based on the perspective & domain
    - DS vs cyber security vs activist
- FEAS Technologies
    - Fairness
    - Explainability
    - Auditability
    - Safety
- A collection of technologies that are "trust-enhancing"
- Trustworthiness is at the heard of the ML build process
- The claimed benefit is that it both ties all steps together and allows for opportunities accessing & rectifying potential issues before they progress too far or too deeply
- Contend that the approach to implementing trustworthy ML is the same as increasing it's accuracy rate
