## Notes

- Challenges exist in:
    - No legal consensus for explanation
    - Not always technically feasible
    - Explanation doesn't equal justification
- Propose 3 layers of explanation:
    - General Information
    - Group based Information
    - Individual Explanation
- GDPR introduces a risk based process
    - The higher the risk the stronger the safegaurds & level of explainability & transperency required
