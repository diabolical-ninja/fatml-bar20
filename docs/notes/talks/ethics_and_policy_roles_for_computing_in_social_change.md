## Notes

Proposes a framing for how computing (FAT* ) can contribute to social good problems

- Computing as a **diagnostic**:
    - computing can assist with measurement of bias
- Computing as a **foraliser**:
    - Models force assumptions & thoughts into formal definitions
    - Can shape how social problems are understood
    - This formalisation runs risks when not transperent
- Computing as a **rebuttal**:
    - Computing can highlight where technical limitations exist & where alternate approaches/solutions are required
- Computing as **synecdoche**:
    - Computing can foreground long-standing social problems in a new way
    - Can force us to reconceptualise & bring new attention to problems
    - Book to read: *"Automating inequality"*
