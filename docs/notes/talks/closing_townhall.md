# Townhall

## Town Hall Part 1 (Form): Organizational Aspects

- Short name change from FAT* -> FAccT
- Conference 2021 will be in Toronto

## Town Hall Part 2 (Content): Trends and Blindspots in FAT* Research

Feedback:
- Research sessions were too fast, not allowing for both sufficient time to present the paper & insufficient time to absord, reflect & think on it
- Vast majority of research, tutorials & CRAFT's were focused on theoretical/academic work with very little looking at real world usage
    - Would challenge the authors to validate their work in a live setting, pre-hoc
    - Would challenge the conference to examine how what it does can more directly be applied & encourage attendees each year to reflect on how the information presented the prior year was used & implemented in the following 12 months. Where did it work? Where did it fall short? Is it possible to implement?
