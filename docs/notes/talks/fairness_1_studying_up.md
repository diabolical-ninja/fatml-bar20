## Notes

- Data scientists don't have the skills/tools yet to address many of the fairness issues that arise
    - End up reproducing existing issues
- Argues that many data science initiatives focus on the downward direction (those suffering the effects) rather than "studying up" & examining the systematic issues creating the problem
- Developed a "role reversed" solution that used all the "naughty" variables that shouldn't be used (ie race, age, gender)
    - The results were more accurate than existing solutions
    - Used as a confrontation mechanism to force decision makers to reflect on their decision making process & consider potential biases present
