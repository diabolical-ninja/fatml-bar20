## Notes

- Want to test the effectiveness of using images to identify & return corressponding labelled searches
    - Eg search for "philanthropist" & images of them are returned
- The students labelling the data were constantly challenged & unable to confidently label the images, often randomly assigning labels
- How can one label an image without context?
