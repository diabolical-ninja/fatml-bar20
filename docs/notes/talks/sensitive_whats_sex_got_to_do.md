## Notes

- What makes algorithmic tools biased?
    - Some contend this is a causal question requiring a causal solution
- Pearl contends social kinds can be represented as causal elements

For example:
- Causal Nodes:
    - Department
    - Gender
    - Feed into: Admission

- Assume independence, the relationships are causal & pathways are modular
- *Modularity*: can change any one node & the other independent nodes won't change
- Papers contends that modularity isn't implicit & doesn't hold
- Eg:
