## Notes

- Study the downstream impacts of data anonymisation when applying privacy tools over aggregate data (eg census data)
- Potential that when applying privacy you risk introducing unfairness as decision makers are informed by "incorrect" data
- Potential remedies:
    - Modify the assignment rule to account for noise
    - Eg over-allocate funding to all thus ensuring no-one loses funding based on privatised data
