## Notes

- What resources exist to determine "fair ML"?
- What resources exist for consumers of ML to ensure fairness is present?
- Often when designing & exposing a resource people are failing to consider all requirements & thus introducing unfairness
    - Eg online job ads disadvantage the blind
- `*add slide on operationalising capabilities*`
