## Notes

- Assessed the bias mitigation techniques available to & used by algorithmic hiring companies
- Data quality issues present in that:
    - Historical data represents historical biases
    - Definitions don't always represent reality, eg binary gender options
    - The 4/5 rule
- Discrepancy exists between how international products are assessed upon import:
    - Physical products must meet all standards
    - Black boxes are difficult/impossible to evaluate against law of the local jurisdiction
        - *currently not assessed*
- Proposed solution is to implement a legal & regulatory framework that requires scrutinising "black box" products in the same manner as physical items
