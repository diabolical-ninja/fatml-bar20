## Notes

- Risk assessments are growing in use across the US criminal justice system, with the theory being:
    - They're objective
    - They replace discriminatory behaviours & lead to reform
- *The impossibility of fairness*:
    - If two groups have different rates of an outcome, then it is impossible for predictions about hose groups to both be calibrated and have balanced errors
- Formal & Substantive Equality
    - **Calibration**: formal equality
        - similar people should be treated similarly
    - **Error Rate Balance**: substantive equality
        - groups obtain similar outcomes, even if that requires accounting for different social conditions across groups
- Issues with algorithmic fairness:
    - Tend to sideline social context, justice etc
    - Can overlook social change & thus can reinforce discrimination
