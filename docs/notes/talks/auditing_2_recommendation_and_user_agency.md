## Notes

- Often see stereotypes in recommendations
- Define recourse via reachability
    - How possible is it for the user to "reach" the recommendations put forward
- Looking at "traditional" recommenders, the more complex the model the lower the recourse for users that have a small history
- Developed an algorithm to assess recourse in a computationally efficient manner
