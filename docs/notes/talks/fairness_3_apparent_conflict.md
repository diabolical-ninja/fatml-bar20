## Notes

- Different fairness types
    - Equal calibration: Equal fairness across groups (race, gender, etc)
    - Individual fairness: Ensure similar individuals are treated the same
        - often termed "consistency"
- How & why do you choose features to define "fairness"?
    - Some must/should/will be excluded. Can this be justified?
- *Egalitarianism*: what features are an acceptable basis for different outcomes?
    - Contends this is a good mechanism to determine what features should be used to define fairness
- For most/all assumptions, it's possible to find reasoning & data that can support it
    - Raises more questions about what how & what fairness measures should capture
