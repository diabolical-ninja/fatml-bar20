## Notes

-  Argues that choosing a model (algorithm) is not objective but in fact a value judgement
- When speaking of accuracy (better RMSE, classification rate, etc) implicitly biases people to promote model performance over other factors such as:
    - How fair the model/use case/solution is
    - Environment consideration of the approach
