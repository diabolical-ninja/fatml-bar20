## Notes

- Want to measure different bidding strategies
- Modelled theoretical possibilities using an [MDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process) 
- The goal is to make for more fair ad outcomes & would intentionally be more biased in the assignment process (which could potentially be illegal)
- Would be technically challenging to implement, much more so than existing processes & would require either an existing ad platform (ie Google), or a new player in the market to facilitate this
