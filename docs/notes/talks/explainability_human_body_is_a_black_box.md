## Notes

- Sepsis watch as an interdisiplenary problem
- Most common cause of in-hospital deaths in the US
- Difficult to define due to the multi-dimenensional nature of it, thus difficult to accurately label observations as sepsis
- If Sepsis can't be explained, is it possible to explain the model/prediction outcomes?
    - Potentially just having trust & accountability is sufficient
- The solution focuses on not just identification/alerting but on post alert monitoring
- In order to build trust they've tried to add as much data transperency as possible.
    - Ability to dig into data
    - All data available
    - Tool available & integrated into the existing workflow
