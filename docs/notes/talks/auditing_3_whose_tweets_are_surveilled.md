## Notes

- Many law enforcement agencies use social media for investigations
- Found distribution differences between twitter data used for investigation by a local police agency & the population distributions for that area
- When investigating the software used by some law enforcement agencies, significant flaws in their software were found:
    - Applying location filters on tweets which is functionality not provided by twitter
    - Search for keywords that are legal, eg *Marijuana* in California
    - etc
- Policing bias will exist when examining social media as it only reflects the users, those that are geo-tagged, public, etc
