## Notes

- Focuses on the impact of legal mechanisms to put forward & enact change in relation to human freedoms & rights
- An historic example is same sex marriage in the US as the courts, not congress, enabled this right
- There are many present & upcoming situations where the courts & litigation will be required to protect & ensure rights:
    - Surveillance
    - Black-box decisioning
- Suggests that rather than focusing on newer & newer legislation there's a lot of existing sufficient legislation. The challenge is enforcement & that collective pressure to ensure proper enforcement is the change required
