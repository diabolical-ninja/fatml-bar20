## Notes

- There's a growing body of items for documenting data but currently a lack of standards or practises regarding documentation of data collection
- Two types:
    - "Laissez-faire": 
        - collect all, wild west approach
        - Tends to be more complete
    - Interventionist: 
        - Review & scrutinise all data before collection

Challenges with data collection:
- Consent
    - Does it exist prior to collection?
- Inclusivity
    - Smaller groups might not have an ability to share data
- Power
    - Whether individuals have the ability to provide data (or have their data captured/collected)
- Transperency
    - Mission statement, full documentation to ensure the process is transperent
- Ethics & Privacy
    - Governance bodies & codes of ethics overseeing the process


Modifications of data, to privatise etc, can introduce trust issues that even post restoration are unable to be reversed.
