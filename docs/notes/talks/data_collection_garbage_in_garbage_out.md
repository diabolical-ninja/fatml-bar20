## Notes

- Many ethical issues in ML systems can be traced back to data quality:
    - issues in the data
    - lack of data
- When labelling data, apply a structured process
    - Define a "coding scheme"
    - Recruit multiple "coders"
    - Have a process for disputes
    - Update the process as/when required
- Human annotation requires sufficient time to design, develop & implement proper methods as well as accounting for likely messiness that will arise
