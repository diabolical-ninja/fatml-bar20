## Notes
- Want to measure how to internet groups/communities grow over time & the exposure required to "indoctrinate" someone
- Calculated similarity of comments between different user groups:
    - Alt lite
    - Intellectual Dark Web (I.D.W)
- Found that the tendency of users in the gateway communities had a higher tendency to enter radical communities than those who started in more traditional media communities
- Unsure of the causal link. Further research required
