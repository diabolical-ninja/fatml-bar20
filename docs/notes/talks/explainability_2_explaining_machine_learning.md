## Notes

- Developed a library to perform this: [Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE) for ML](https://github.com/microsoft/DiCE)
- Is a counterfactual (CF) implementation
- The goal was to help inform the user where the decision boundary is
- Incorporates causal knowledge when identifying CF's
