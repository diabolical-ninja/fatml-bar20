## Notes

- People change responses based on how decisions are made
- Approach proposed struggles when there's heterogeneity across groups
    - requires a **zero-error** (or near) to reach an optimal state
- Unsure of the long term effectiveness of the approach
    - Appears to be dependent on the system dynamics
- Likely requires retraining the humans as much as the models
