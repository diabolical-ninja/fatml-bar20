## Notes

- Contends that while population has spiked over time due to technology advancements, is recent times (last 30-40 years) both productivity & business dynamism have either flatlined or decreased, especially when compared to the 30-40years prior ("the glorious 30's")
- *Skills biased technical change*
    - Based on the theory that new skills drive growth & change
    - Historical theory (basic model) of productivity
- Context for power in social relations. Each feed on another:
    - Technology <->
    - Institutions (Law & Norms) <->
    - Culture <->
- Contends "power" is a fundamental part of systems. It's there, it can't be removed.
    - Organisations then compete to acquire more of the power & transfer ownership
- Two types of power:
    - Horizontal: shared across a broader base of players. Governments, business, employees, etc
    - Vertical: Focused in one institute/collection of institutes Increasing competition amongst employees & reduces their collective bargaining power
- Power is a fundamental part of business strategy
- Discrimination arises because it's "easy" to categorise for the purpose of measurement but many of these items are more fluid, such as gender & race
- Claims anti-discrimination is a common corporate goal but anti-exploitation isn't
- `*insert diagnosis slides*`
- Exploitation & discrimination are distinctly different entities
    - Fairness as a necessity must consider both





*Question: Assuming individuals should have freedom to choose, what if a perfect company has an employee that wants to work overtime*
1. Is that exploitation?
2. Should the company reward the employee? Or should they discourage & implement strategies to limit that behaviour?
3. How should the employer consider the performance of this employee vs a "regular" employee?
4. Is it exploiting them & sending unfair signals if that employee is rewarded for that behaviour?
