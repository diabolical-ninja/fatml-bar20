## Notes

- Add fairness warnings to model usage
    - A boundary that defines where the model may behave unfairly
    - Could be extended beyond just fairness & to all implementation use cases & considerations
- Fair-MAML
    - a meta learning approach
    - *model agnostic meta-learning*
- Connect:
    - Join fairness warnings & fair-MAML & use the methods together
