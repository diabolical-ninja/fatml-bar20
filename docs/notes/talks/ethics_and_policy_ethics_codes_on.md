## Notes

- Investigating whether digital platforms reinforce societal stigmas &/or create new forms of disparities
- People feel exposed online as the attitudes & behaviours developed online can spill over into real world consequences
- Technological solutions are rarely sufficient to create social change
- Recommendation is to build technology in collaboration with the communities that will be impacted/interact with them
