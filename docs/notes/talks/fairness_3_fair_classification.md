## Notes

- Attempt to incorporate fairness constraints into objective functions in SVM's
- Conceptual formulation similar to differential privacy
    - Add a "fairness constraints" called epsilon
    - Can tighten/loosen & thus add more/less fairness
    - Fair = epsilon closer to zero
- Observered that some solutions that tend to "more fair" offer lower welfare outcomes
    - Raises other concerns & violates the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)
