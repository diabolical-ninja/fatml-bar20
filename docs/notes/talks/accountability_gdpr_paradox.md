## Notes

- scope exists within GDPR to use automated tooling to develop, create & capture metrics/measures as long as scope remains for HITL decision making
    - Primarily for government entities
- Functions as a loop-hole for government to development data driven "surveillance" mechanisms. Eg
    - tax validation in the UK revenue & customs
    - money laundering validation
- Difficult to separate between "public interest/good" & those that are not, especially when the technologies are sourced from 3rd parties
