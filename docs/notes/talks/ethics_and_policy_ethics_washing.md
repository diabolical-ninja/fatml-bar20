## Notes

- Goal is to clarify what ethics is AI is
- Ethics washing
    - to clean or wash a companies reputation through ethics
- Differentiates between:
    - Ethics as a mode of inquiry (philosophy)
    - Ethics as a corporate strategy
- Raises concerns that in-house (corporate) strategies to ethics could lead to push back against regulatory or legislative oversight
- The context that ethics are considered in can themselves influence how ethics are defined, measured & implemented
