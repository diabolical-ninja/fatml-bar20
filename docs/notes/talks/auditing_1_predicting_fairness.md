## Notes

- Tradeoffs exist when fitting to your fairness measure, eg:
    - Equalise recall
    - Equity vs Efficiency
- Built a model to identify the 150 highest risk individuals when it came to recidivism then wanted to refactor it to equalise recall across ethnicity
- Options to resolve could be:
    - expand program to equalise results (collect more data)
