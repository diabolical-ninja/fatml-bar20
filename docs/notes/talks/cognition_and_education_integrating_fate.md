## Notes

- "Type 2" data scientist
    - More focused on user needs rather than programming heavy

- CDS: critical data studies
- Struggled to achieve deeper integration across both the students (international vs local) & integration across the broader course

- Recommendations:
    - Create more empathetic learning spaces
    - Make it easy to share materials
    - Collaborate across borders & cultures to ensure it's more global leaning/thinking
